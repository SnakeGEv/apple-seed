An open-world game inspired by [Roark's Attack On Titan](https://roarkdev.itch.io/raot)

## Motivation

[Attack On Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan) is a wonderful manga with a deep and sad history, while the anime is good, the games not.

The Attack On Titan games has complex mechanics and bad performance for low/mid-end computers, killing the fun to play the game.

We consider the Roark's Attack On Titan fan game the best effort to create a good adaptation, but the mechanics are still complex, even with a gamepad.

The fan game ended its development (verify their Discord announcements), thus their players don't get updates anymore.

We want to change the Attack On Titan gaming scenario once for all with a great game with easy mechanics and good performance.

## Goals

- A open-world with anime accuracy on the buildings
- Reallistic physics
- Multiplayer
- A living environment based on the manga society and technology
- A police system, like Grand Theft Auto
- Implement all weapons of the manga
